# go-kimpton-dclonetracker
A discord bot for getting dclone alerts

- Build: `go build .\cmd\discordbot\server.go`
- Run: `.\server.exe -discordtoken='ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP'` where `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP` is your discord bot access token

Special thanks to Teebling from https://diablo2.io/

I have compiled the binary for windows, which you can find here: https://github.com/A-Kimpton/go-kimpton-dclonetracker/releases/tag/latestbuild

Otherwise the build script is in the source, its just the standard go build command.
